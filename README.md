# coding-journey

This repository is a public log of my growth as a developer.

It documents what I learn, build, break, and fix across programming, systems, tooling, and problem-solving. The focus is on understanding fundamentals, developing good engineering habits, and improving thinking over time—not on polished tutorials or quick wins.

## What This Repository Contains

- Learning logs and reflections  
- Small experiments and practice projects  
- Notes on mistakes, debugging, and fixes  
- Explanations written for future reference  

## What This Repository Is Not

- A tutorial series  
- A curated portfolio of only “finished” work  
- A place for copy-pasted solutions  

Incomplete ideas, confusion, and failed attempts are part of the process and are intentionally included.

## Structure (Evolving)

- logs/ # Daily or weekly learning notes
- projects/ # Small experiments and practice builds
- notes/ # Concepts, explanations, and references
- mistakes/ # Things that broke and what I learned fixing them

## Goals

- Learn in public and stay accountable  
- Build long-term technical depth  
- Improve clarity of thought and explanation  
- Create a reliable record of progress
